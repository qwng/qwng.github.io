I am a fifth year PhD candidate of [Department of Statistics](https://www.stat.purdue.edu) at [Purdue University](http://www.purdue.edu). 
My research interests lies in the area of Bayesian nonparametrics, machine learning and statistical genetics. 
My advisor is Prof. [Vinayak Rao](https://varao.github.io). Now I focus my research on developing an auxiliary variable Gibbs 
sampler for exact simulation of stochastic differential equations that improves the sample generating efficiency in orders
of magnitude than existing methods. Please refer to my resume for detail.
