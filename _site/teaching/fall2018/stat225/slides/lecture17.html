				<li><b>The definition of $X$</b>: the number of success per $\underline{\hspace{1cm}}$, and $\underline{\hspace{1cm}}$ can be time, length, space unit and so on</li>
				<li><b>Support:</b> $\{0, 1, 2, \cdots\}$</li>
				<li><b>Parameters:</b> $\lambda$, the average success rate per $\underline{\hspace{1cm}}$</li>
				<li><b>PMF:</b> $P_X(x) = \frac{e^{-\lambda} \lambda^x}{x!}$</li>
				<li><b>Expected Value:</b> $E[X] = \lambda$</li>
				<li><b>Variance:</b> $Var(X) = \lambda$</li>
				<li>$X \sim Poisson(\lambda)$</li>

			<h3>Rule for using a POISSON to approximate a BINOMIAL random variable:</h3>
	      <p align="left">
	      	If $X \sim Bin(n, p)$ with <b>$n>100$ AND $p<0.01$</b>, we can approximate $X$ by $X^\star \sim Poisson(\lambda = np)$

			<h2>Example 1</h2>
			<p>
				Suppose earthquakes occur in the western US on average at a rate of 2 per week. Let $X$ be the number of earthquakes in the western US this week.
				<ul>
        	<li>Find the probability that $X$ is 3. What distribution and parameter(s) are you using?</li>
        	<li>What is the probability that there are at least 2 earthquakes in a week in the western US? </li>
        	<li>What is the expected number of earthquakes and the standard deviation of the number of earthquakes in the western US in a week?  </li>
        </ul>
				<div>
				Now consider a month.  Let Y be the number of earthquakes in the western US this month(assume that 1 month is equivalent to 4 weeks).
			</div>
				<ul>
					<li>Find the probability that Y is 12. What distribution and parameter(s) are you using?</li>
					<li>Let $Z$ be the number of weeks in a 4 week period that have a week with 3 earthquakes in the western US. Find the probability that $Z$ is 4. Is this the same as the probability that $Y$ is 12? Does this make sense?</li>

			<h3>Example 2</h3>
			<p>
				Customers arrive at the UPS store randomly and independently at a rate of 15 per hour.
				<ol>
					<li>What is the probability that 45 customers arrive between 11:30 am and 3:00 pm? What distribution and parameter(s) are you using?  What is the support?</li>
					<li>What is the probability that 45 customers arrive between 11:30 am and 3:00 pm AND 10 customers arrive between 3:00 pm and 3:45 pm?</li>

			<h3>Example 3</h3>
			<p>
			 Flaws on an old computer tape occur on average every 1200 feet.  You have an old computer tape roll that is 4800 feet long.
				<ol>
					<li>What is the probability that there is at least one flaw on that roll?</li>
					<li>You know that there is at least one flaw on the roll.  Knowing this, what is the probability that there are 2 or 3 flaws on the roll?</li>

			<h3>Example 4</h3>
			<p>
			A certain disease occurs in 7 out of 5000 people.  We will conduct a study and take a sample of 1000 people.  What is the probability that no one in the sample has the disease?
