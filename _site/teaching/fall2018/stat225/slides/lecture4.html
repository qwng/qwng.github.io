 			<h3>Example 1</h3>
 		 <p>
 			 Drew is a risk taker. On any given weekend, Drew takes risks with or without monetary compensation.
			 He gets paid 20% of the time he takes risks. The risks involved are to either drink something weird
			 (like garlic butter) or do something silly (like shave his head into a mohawk).
			 Drew gets paid and drinks something weird 16% of the time. Drew does not get paid and drinks something weird 72% of the time.
 			 <ol>
 				 <li>What is the probability Drew drinks something weird?</li>
 				 <li>What is the probability he does something silly? </li>
 			 </ol>

	 			<h3>Example 2</h3>
	 			<p>You are previewing movies for your young nephew. You have 1284 movies available to view, 272 of which are G-rated. Your nephew
	 			enjoys movies with puppets, which make up 94 of your G-rated movies. There are only 30 movies with puppets that are not G-rated. if
	 		you happen to pick a movie that has puppets, what is the probability that it is G-rated?</p>

			<h2>Multiplication Rule</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}$</li>
				<li>$P(A\cap B) = P(B) \times P(A|B) = P(A) \times P(B|A )$</li>
				<li>The probability that Events A and B both occur is equal to the
					probability that Event B occurs times the probability that Event A occurs,
					given that B has occurred</li>

			<h3>Example 3</h3>
			<p>Three cards are dealt successively at random and without replacement from a standard
				deck of 52 playing cards. What is the probability of receiving, in order, a king, a queen, and a jack?</p>
