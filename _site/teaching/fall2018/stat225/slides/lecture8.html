					<h3>Example 1</h3>
					<p align="left">Assuming Mary has 6 pairs of shoes, 10 different tops,
						8 different bottoms and 4 different jackets.
						<ol>
							<li>How many different outfits can she wear?</li>
							<li>Mary has a job interview and she wants to decide what to wear.
								Of all her clothes, Mary  has 2 pairs of shoes, 3 tops, 2 bottoms
								and 2 jackets that are appropriate for an interview.
								She randomly picks what to wear for the interview among
								all her possible outfits, what is the probability that s
								he wears an interview-appropriate outfit?</li>

					<h3>Example 2</h3>
					<font size="6">
					<p align="left">
						lllinois license plates consist of 4 digits followed by 2 letters.
						Whereas, in Ohio, license plates start with 3 letters and end with 4 digits.
						Assume all letters are upper case.(note: the license plate scheme described may not
						reflect the current Illinois or Ohio license plates)
						<ol>
							<li>For each state, how many possible license plates are there?</li>
							<li>How many possible license plates are there for each state with no digit or letter repeating?</li>
							<li>How many possible license plates are there with at least 1 vowel?</li>
							<li>How many possible license plates are there with at least one vowel or at least one 3?  </li>
							<li>What is the probability that the license plate will have at least one vowel?</li>

				 <h2>Permutation</h2>
				</section>

				<section data-transition="zoom" style="text-align: left;">
					<h2>Two concepts</h2>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>Factorial Notation: $k!$ means multiple the positive integer $k$
								by $k - 1, k-2, \cdots, $ until 1
								\begin{align}
								k! =& k\times (k-1) \times \cdots \times 2 \times 1 \\
								6! =& 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 720
								\end{align}
	 				    </li>
							<li>Permutation: Ordered arrangement of r distinct objects
							from a set of n objects.
							$$_nP_r =  P_r^n = \frac{n!}{(n - r)!}$$
							$$_5P_2 = P_2^5 = \frac{5!}{(5 - 2)!} = \frac{5!}{3!} = 20$$
						</li>
						</ul>

					<h3>Example 3</h3>
					<font size="5">
					<p align="left">
						Suppose Krannert only allows 5 spaces for a password to Portals.
						Suppose further you are only allowed to use a number or a letter,
						but the system is not case sensitive.
						<ol>
							<li>How many possible passwords are there? </li>
							<li>What is the probability that you do not have a 9 in the first position?</li>
							<li>What is the probability that all 5 spaces are odd numbers?  What if you cannot have a 9 in the first space?</li>
							<li>What is the probability that a password does not repeat any characters?</li>
							<li>What is the probability that the first space is a letter?</li>
							<li>What is the probability that the $4_{th}$ space is an even number?</li>
							<li>What is the probability that the last two spaces are vowels, if repeats are allowed?
								If repeats are not allowed?</li>
							<li>What is the probability that the password has at least one letter?</li>
