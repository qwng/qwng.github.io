<h1><a name="about"></a>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a final year PhD candidate of <a href="https://www.stat.purdue.edu">Department of Statistics</a> at <a href="http://www.purdue.edu">Purdue University</a>.
My research interest lies in the area of Bayesian nonparametrics, machine learning and statistical genetics.
My advisor is Prof. <a href="https://varao.github.io/">Vinayak Rao</a>.
Currently my research focuses on developing a novel algorithm for exact simulation of stochastic differential equations via auxiliary variable Gibbs sampler 
that can improve the sample generating efficiency in orders of magnitude than existing methods.
